## Repository structure

This repository contains a few necessary packages to help you get started building your new integration:

- `apps/app` - Demonstrates the usage of `prestashop/api-client` by creating a nuxt 3 app. You can use this directory to demonstrate the usage of the integration.
- `apps/middleware` - An express app that uses the `prestashop/api-client` to create a server-to-server connection with service providers (e.g. commerce backend).
- `packages/api-client` - The service the middleware uses. It contains some of the implemented endpoints.
- `packages/sdk`- Think of the SDK Connector as a communication layer between the storefront and the middleware. It contains some implemented methods.
